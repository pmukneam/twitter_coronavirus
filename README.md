# Coronavirus: Twitter Hashtag Analysis

In this project, we analyze aspects of tweets with the hashtags `#coronavirus` and `#코로나바이러스` from 2020. Specifically, we investigate the distribution of Twitter user countries and the languages used in these tweets. We focus on the top 10 countries and languages in our analysis.

Our findings are presented in the following graphs:

## #코로나바이러스

  <img src="country__#코로나바이러스.png" width=50% />
</p>

The two plots are correlated, given that the hashtag we are analyzing is in Korean. As expected, the majority of tweets originated from Korea. However, there were also some number of English tweets, as well as some unidentified languages.

## #coronavirus

Unlike the previous hashtag, `#coronavirus` was more widely used in geo-tweets from 2020. We observe that the majority of tweets were from the United States, followed by India and the United Kingdom. While English was the most commonly used language, Spanish and other identified languages were also present.
